# copilot-rock-paper-scissors-demo

## Overview
This code implements a simple game of rock, paper, scissors where the player competes against the computer. The computer's choice is randomly generated, while the program prompts the user for their input. The game ends after one player wins best out of three rounds. After each round, the function prints who won that round and the overall score.

## How it Works
The game is implemented as a Python function called game(). The function starts by printing a welcome message to the console. It then initializes the scores for the player and the computer to 0.

The game is played in a loop that continues until one player wins best out of three rounds. In each iteration of the loop, the function prompts the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors by calling the input() function. The user's choice is stored in a variable called user_choice.

The computer's choice is generated randomly using the random.randint() function. The function generates a random integer between 1 and 3, inclusive. The integer is then mapped to a choice of rock, paper, or scissors using a series of if-elif-else statements.

The function then compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner of the round. If the user wins the round, their score is incremented by 1. If the computer wins the round, its score is incremented by 1. If the round is a tie, neither score is incremented.

After each round, the function prints a message indicating who won the round and the current score. Once one player has won best out of three rounds, the function prints a message indicating who won the game.

Finally, the function asks the user if they want to play again. If the user enters "y", the function calls itself recursively to start a new game. If the user enters "n", the function prints a message thanking the user for playing and exits.

## Building Your Own Game
To build your own rock, paper, scissors game, you can start by copying the code from this example and modifying it to suit your needs. Here are some tips to get you started:

* Customize the welcome message and the prompts for user input to fit your game.
* Modify the rules of the game to suit your needs. For example, you could add additional choices or change the winning conditions.
* Add additional logic to handle edge cases, such as invalid user input or ties.
* Customize the messages printed to the console to fit your game.
* Add additional features, such as a graphical user interface or multiplayer support.

Remember to test your game thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. You can use unit tests to automate the testing process and catch bugs early.
